This repository is dedicated to a real-life computer vision application with OpenCV. Precisely, building a Python application for document scanning using a series of morphological transformations.

In my view, a document scanner should perform two operations on the document (input image):
1) To properly rotate images (no random angles);
2) To change the document look into a scan-like (B&W) colour scheme.

I am building the routine that does exactly these two operations.

To learn more about this class and about its methods, run the following command:
